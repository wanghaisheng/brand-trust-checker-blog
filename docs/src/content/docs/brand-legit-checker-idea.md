Dear readers,

In today's post, I want to explore three key questions about AI tools in the creative realization process:

Idea to Plan: Can AI tools transform an idea in our minds into a relatively complete plan?
Competitiveness Assessment: Can deep AI evaluate our ability or competitiveness in the process of transforming ideas into plans?
Generating Promotional Pages: Once we have a plan, can generative AI tools directly generate a functional promotional page?
Last weekend, while conducting a Google search, I encountered a question posed by a brand: "Is Temu legit or is somebrand website legit?" I presented this question to Kimi AI, and it quickly provided a response. Based on this response, I further inquired if Kimi AI could create a generalized tool around this plan. Soon after, I received a fairly comprehensive creative plan.

To optimize the plan, I proposed using the 5W1H framework and integrated the optimized results with the previous plan content. After making some personalized adjustments and several hours of refinement, I finally formed a small tool plan called "Brand Trust." This preliminarily solved the first question.

Next, I assessed the competitiveness of the plan by submitting the highlights and unique features of the designed small tool to AI tools. Since Kimi AI does not have real-time online search capabilities, I used Mita AI. Based on the information I provided, it quickly generated over 70 references from nearly 30 sources and assessed the competitiveness of the plan. The results were satisfactory.

Finally, I tackled the issue of generating actual promotional pages from the plan. My principle was not to tell the AI tool specific page design requirements but to rely solely on the provided plan text and let it design independently. I input the organized plan content into Kimi Chat and Claude, two AI tools, and asked them to generate HTML code for the landing page, including CSS styles. The generated code not only included simple styles but also supported multiple languages, Chinese-English language switching, and the design of several commonly used pages in the footer.

After less than three hours of debugging, I obtained a code that can run and be deployed on the Vercel server. I have uploaded the code to the platform, and you can click on the link to view the generated effect. Although the effect is not stunning, from the perspective of verifying ideas, I am personally satisfied.

Previously, after having a plan, to obtain a functional promotional page, my workflow was generally like this: I would search for relevant keywords on GitHub, such as "SaaS template" or "landing page," then review them one by one and try to find a design page that met my expectations, and make necessary modifications. Although I cannot write code, I can handle simple tasks like copying and pasting.

This is what I wanted to share with you today, and I hope you can gain some inspiration from it. AI tools are revolutionizing the creative process, from ideation to planning, competitiveness assessment, and even generating promotional pages. By leveraging these powerful tools, we can streamline our workflows and bring our ideas to life more efficiently than ever before.

I encourage you to explore these AI tools and see how they can enhance your creative process. Whether you're a designer, developer, or entrepreneur, AI can help you transform your ideas into reality with greater ease and speed.

Thank you for reading, and I look forward to hearing your thoughts and experiences with AI in the creative realization process.

Best regards,
